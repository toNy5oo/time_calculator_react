# Timer Calculator for a Pool Club

The app was developed as helper for the club where I play. The 12 tables available can be with one click opened and the "start time" set itself directly on the closest 5 minute gap on the time the click has been done.
Once the "finish time" is set, the table would show the current amount to pay and will offer the chance to split the bill, save the table aside in order to open a new one (in case the guests will stay after closing the table to finish their drinks)
